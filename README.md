# Lattices
Homework 1 for Computational Physics

## Introduction
In this repo I want to implement a program for simulating parts of the lattices used commonly in Physics.

### Square Lattice with Periodic Boundary Conditions
In principle, such a generic purpose should not be implemented too much specifically.
However, considering the fact that there are only hours till the deadline of this homework, I decided to start from such a concrete and simple model.
