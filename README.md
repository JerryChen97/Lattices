# Lattices
A package for generic lattices commonly used in physics, based on my homework 1 for computational physics.

## Introduction
Lattices are usually defined the same as the lattice groups in mathematics:

which is the symmetry group of discrete translational symmetry in `n` directions. It is also a finitely-generated free Abelian group which is isomorphic to <img src="/tex/21ef41b2ac27655547b06a64a994d050.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=19.084964249999988pt height=22.648391699999998pt/>
