# Lattices
A package for generic lattices commonly used in physics, based on my homework 1 for computational physics.

## Introduction
Lattices are usually defined the same as the lattice groups in mathematics:

$$\Lambda=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} v_{i} | a_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$$
which is the symmetry group of discrete translational symmetry in `n` directions.
